# PowerDocu Roadmap

Below is an approximate roadmap for PowerDocu which includes all functionalities that I intend to add at some point. Please note that this depends on my availability, as well as potential interest by PowerDocu users. The roadmap may change over time, and I will do my best to keep it updated here

The table below lists all functionalities that are under consideration, in descending order of "importance". The higher up something is, the sooner it will be implemented. If there is anything else that you think should be added, please let me know by opening a new [Discussion](https://github.com/modery/PowerDocu/discussions)

| Feature | Comment | Status |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| Detailed Dataverse documentation | A first version of Dataverse table documentation is available. There are still a lot of things that haven't been implemented yet, such as relationships between tables, other table properties, views, forms, etc. | In progress |
| Solution documentation | This will be an ongoing thing for a while. Solutions already get documented, but there are lots of areas for improvement | In progress |
| Model-Driven Apps | Once Dataverse table documentation has been completed, it should be relatively easy to start with MDAs. | Planned |
| PowerShell/Console support | Besides the current GUI, there is also a good interest in having some PowerShell/console functionality that allows to generate documentation through other processes. For example, it should be possible to generate documentation through Azure DevOps | Planned |
| Power Automate Desktop Flows | Under consideration | Planned |
| Business Process Flows | Under consideration | Planned |
